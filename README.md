# DV Stick Bluetooth player

Heavily inspired by/copied from [Gadgetoid's Unicorn Bluetooth](https://github.com/Gadgetoid/galactic-bluetooth-audio) player, this one works with the Pimoroni DV stick.

Currently very basic, but demos driving the display and audio together.

You will need to checkout the `develop` branch of `pico-sdk` and the commit `6544475` of `lib/btstack` within the pico-sdk in order to build - the cover art support is not available in the main branch of pico-sdk yet.
